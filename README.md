# Bento!

Personal documents for your personal cloud.

I created Bento because I wanted to escape from Google and Amazon. There are other options out there but they all had flaws in their own way:

1. Proton Drive: Doesn't exist yet!
2. Crypt Pad: poor mobile support
3. Only Office: Pain in the neck to get to work and supper heavy
4. Open365: It's libre office, in the cloud. It's not great. Not scriptable.

So I started out on a little exercise to make something that addresses my particular needs. And that is one of the things that sets Bento appart from the other options: It is personal. It is not meant to ever progress into something you would use for a small business. It is meant for an individual or a family, nothing more.

This is where it's name comes in. A Bento Box is a personal lunch box used by the Japanese (simplicifaction). And that is what I think of when I think of this project: Small and personal.

Priorities:
1. Runs on Web and Mobile
2. Stable. My wife will be using this so I want it to not be down all the time (unlike plex...)
3. Light. This will be running on a Raspberry Pi. It should be very light so as to fit inside such an environment easily.
4. Scriptable. I want to connect automations to this so it needs to be scriptable via REST api.

0.2
